# SmartSeva
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of multiple machine learning models using Python.
The notebook (4icmodels.ipynb) covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and performance evaluation.

The goal of this project is to compare different models and understand their behavior on a given dataset.
